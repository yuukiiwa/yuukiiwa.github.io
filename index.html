	<h1>Animal Encounters</h1>
    <p>I'm a 23 year-old who loves the nature and animals.</p>
    <p>I love traveling, which my college roomate Danielle said that I flipped the country in a semester.</p>
    <p>Someday, I want to be a proud mom of a Corgi, and I'm saving up money for that.</p>
    <p>Here I'm sharing some of my encounters with my furry friends from all over the world.</p>
    <p>Cuba, Japan, Michigan, Maryland, Norway, Italy, Corsica, France, Turkey, Spain, and counting</p>
